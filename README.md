# SudokuPyCSF
This is part of my A.I. course learning projects. Here you can find an implementation of [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) search algorithm with two different heuristics(Minimum Remaining Value(MRV) and degree), an implementation of [min-conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-conflicts_algorithm) local search algorithm for solving sudoku using [CSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) approach, and also a simple python console application that reads an input sudoku from _input.py_ and solves it using one of above algorithms.
